"say Oh yeah level 3... bit of a badly designed puzzle if you ask me! Too much backtracking!"
"say Use the terminal next to the doors to get some web and a pink key! Go through the pink door and traverse the gaps to collect more web and a blue key! Now go through the blue door and get the last bit of web! Go back to where the bomb went off and traverse the big gap! Use the PC to the right to switch off the app lock! Go back through the blue door and use the PC there to get the chisel! Go to the strange crack and use the hammer and chisel on it! Jump through the hole, collect the purple key and use it on the purple door!"
