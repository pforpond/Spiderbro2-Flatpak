"say In level 7 you must first use the PC to get the purple key! Go through the purple hole, ride the elevator and go through the purple door! Pull on the rope, then get the battery to the left! Ride the elevator again and return to the shadow world! Now go get a plastic bottle from the box and fill it up with lubricant from the dispenser! Go through the door near the PC and charge the battery using the battery charger! Now use the battery and the lubricant on the broken robot! Use the PC to ask for assistance and then go through the newly opened door!"
