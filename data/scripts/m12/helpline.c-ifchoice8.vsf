"say Oh yeah level 8 can be a tough one! Lots of people lost in that maze! Maze puzzles are the worst! But don't worry I can get you through it!"
"say Walk to the right and after seeing the pile of plastic bottles, go through the nearby door! Ask for assistance from the PC! Now go back to the plastic bottle room and jump into the new hole! Now go to the left to a room with four doors! Take the 4th door, then the 3rd, then the 2nd and finally the 1st! See, told you I'd get you through it! Use the PC to get back you floppy disk! Return to the start of the door maze and go right until you reach a room full of crates! Use the PC and request crate 3! Get the battery from the crate then return to the room where your floppy disk was stolen! Now use the battery with the broken robot and then request assistance from the PC! Go through the newly opened door to finish the level!"
